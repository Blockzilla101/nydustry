## Nydustry
Implements the features of the nydus server as a js mod

## Features
### Implemented
- thorium reactor explosions destroy terrain (thanks to [ZestyLemonade](https://github.com/sample-text-here) for helping me with this)

### In Progress
(TODO)

### Probably won't recreate
- enemies that die near your core give you what they carry
- certain blocks downgrade instead of being destroyed
- using a door also toggles the doors next to it (already implemented in the vanilla game)
- magma tiles set fire to anything other than thermal generators
- duo turrets can lob copper walls at the enemy
- getting close to an enemy repair point switches your team
- miner drones work from home due to corona ***(n o)***
- rocks can only be moved by ground mechs (why would you move rocks anyway)
- water from the nile gives free water to some blocks (i have no idea how this works so nope)
- game of life in mindustry (too lazy to code a self playing game)
