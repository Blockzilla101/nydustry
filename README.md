## Nydustry
Implements the features of the nydus server as a js mod

## Features
### Implemented
- thorium reactor explosions destroy terrain (thanks to [ZestyLemonade](https://github.com/sample-text-here) for helping me with this)
- the pyratite mixer contains free lead (again thanks to zesty)
- separators contain free slag
- cryofluid is extracted from titanium without water
- separators that are clogged make titanium

### In Progress
- airblast drills periodically gives 5 bonus items (amazing typo quez)
- drowning in deep water while holding items creates land
- placing a pulverizer on any ore gives it infinite scrap
- several blocks of the same type might merge into one
- rtg generators share fuel with adjacent ones
- batteries contain a little power when placed
- overdrivers get free phase when surrounded by phase walls
- forcefields get free phase when surrounded by phase walls
- phase weavers get free thorium when surrounded by thorium walls
- you can boost thorium reactors by surrounding them with thorium walls
- TODO add v6 features to this list.

### Probably won't recreate
- enemies that die near your core give you what they carry
- certain blocks downgrade instead of being destroyed
- using a door also toggles the doors next to it (already implemented in the vanilla game)
- magma tiles set fire to anything other than thermal generators
- duo turrets can lob copper walls at the enemy
- getting close to an enemy repair point switches your team
- miner drones work from home due to corona ***(n o)***
- rocks can only be moved by ground mechs (why would you move rocks anyway)
- a launchpad can upgrade blocks automatically for your team (this is replaced with block forge in v6)
- water from the nile gives free water to some blocks (i have no idea how this works so nope)
- game of life in mindustry (too lazy to code a self playing game)
